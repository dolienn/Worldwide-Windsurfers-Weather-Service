## Jenkins Integration
Jenkins is used in this project for continuous integration and deployment. The Jenkins pipeline automates the build, test, and deployment process, ensuring that every code change is properly tested and deployed.

### Jenkins Pipeline
The project uses a Jenkins pipeline with the following stages:
- **Build**: Compile the project using Maven.
- **Test**: Run the unit tests to ensure the application works as expected.
- **Deploy**: Deploy the application to Heroku.

### How to Set Up Jenkins for the Project:

1. **Install Jenkins**: If you don‚Äôt have Jenkins installed, you can follow the installation instructions [here](https://www.jenkins.io/download/).
2. **Create a New Job in Jenkins**:
   - Go to your Jenkins dashboard and click on **New Item**.
   - Select **Pipeline** and give your job a name, e.g., `windsurfers-weather-service-pipeline`.
3. **Configure SCM**
   - In the **Pipeline** section, change the **Definition** to **Pipeline script from SCM**
   - Choose **SCM** as **Git**.
   - Enter the **Repository URL** pointing to your GitHub repository (e.g., `https://github.com/your_user_name/windsurfers-weather-service.git`).
   - If your repository is private, you'll need to add credentials in Jenkins to allow it to access your GitHub.
4. **Add Required Environment Variables**:
    - Go to the **Manage Jenkins** in Dashboard, then **System**.
    - In the **Global properties** section, check the **Environment variables** and add the following environment variables:

   <table border="1" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0">
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Environment Variable</th>
                <th>Value</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td><code>HEROKU_API_KEY</code></td>
                <td>This is your Heroku API key used for deploying the app to Heroku</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>HEROKU_URL</code></td>
                <td>The URL of your Heroku app (e.g., https://your-app-name.herokuapp.com)</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>WEATHERBIT_API_KEY</code></td>
                <td>The Weatherbit API key used to fetch weather data</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td><code>WEATHERBIT_URL</code></td>
                <td>https://api.weatherbit.io/v2.0/forecast/daily</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

## Verifying Application Functionality
To ensure the Worldwide Windsurfers Weather Service is working correctly after setup, follow these steps:
- **Access the API Endpoints:**
  - Open a browser or use tools like Postman/cURL to test the following endpoints:
    - `GET /api/windsurfing/best-location`: Navigate to `http://localhost:8080/api/windsurfing/best-location?date=your_chosen_date` to fetch the city with the best windsurfing conditions. Expected response: JSON data with the city name, wind speed, and temperature.
    -  `GET /api/windsurfing/locations`: Go to `http://localhost:8080/api/windsurfing/locations` to get a list of cities and their current weather data. Expected response: A JSON array containing multiple cities, each with weather information (e.g., wind speed, temperature).
   
- **Frontend Verification:**
  - Once the backend and frontend are running, open a browser and visit `http://localhost:80` (for local setup) or the live version at: [üåê Live App](https://windsurfers-weather-service-b435c5ef89a3.herokuapp.com/)
  - Verify that the app displays the current weather conditions and allows you to select different dates. After choosing a date, the application should show the best location for windsurfing on that specific date based on the forecast data.
 
- **Test Basic Functionality:**
  - Best Location: Check if the "Best Location" feature identifies a suitable city for windsurfing based on real-time or future date weather data.
  - Location Search: Search or browse through cities to ensure accurate weather data is being fetched and displayed for the selected dates.
  - Responsive UI: Test the app across different devices or screen sizes to ensure a smooth and adaptive user experience.

By following these steps, you can confirm that the application is working as expected both locally and online.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues, try the following:

1. Verify that Docker and Docker Compose are properly installed and running

2. Check the logs for any errors:

   ```bash
   docker-compose logs
